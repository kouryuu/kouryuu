## Welcome 🇺🇸 Bienvenido 🇲🇽 Wilkommen 🇩🇪 ようこそ 🇯🇵

This is my GitHub, this is where my code lives.

### Who am I?🇺🇸 ¿Quién soy?🇲🇽 Wer bin ich? だれ🇯🇵

He/him

I am a Computer Scientist that likes to code for fun and for a living.

### Subjects I like

- UX and Usability
- Cryptocurrencies
- Open Source Software

### Programming Languages I work with

- Javascript (ehem ECMAScript 🤓 and yes including but not limited to flavours of Typescript, Flow, and ES6)
- Python (mostly 3 but I used to do 2 🐍)
- Solidity (yeah EVM ftw 🙌)
- C (this was heavily used in college but I only use it when I want to do stuff with the bare metal like Arduino or some specific programs 💪)

### Programming Languages I am learning

- Go
- Rust
- OCaml

### Favorite sorting algorithm

Merge sort: because it's easy to implement and has a decent average O.

### Favorite data structure

Bloom filters: because they sometimes lie to you, but that's ok.

### How to reach me?

rodrigo@plethora.com.mx _please don't spam_ (you are however encouraged to reports bugs on public or OSS I write).

### Cat
Last but not least a picture of my cat, since the internet is not entirely full of them anyway. 🐈
